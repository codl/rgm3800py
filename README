This is a continuation of rgm3800py by Karsten Petersen, a command line utility
for the RGM-3800 GPS logger.

It is being ported to Python 3. It's not at all ready for use.

Oh, also I don't plan to support macOS or Windows at all, since I don't have
access to those, and I will probably be ripping those parts out. Make yourself
known if you're interested in maintaining those platforms.

Promise, I will write a better readme when this is ready for prime time.
